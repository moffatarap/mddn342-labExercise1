                <div class="four columns">
                    <p>General Hammond summons Colonel Jack O'Neill out of retirement to embark on a secret rescue mission.
                    O'Neill confesses that he disobeyed orders to destroy the Stargate on Planet Abydos, and that scientist Daniel Jackson may still be alive.
                    Arriving on Abydos with his team, O'Neill meets up once again with the scientist, who has discovered a giant elaborate cartouche in hieroglyphics.
                    All signs point to the fact that this is a map of many Stargates that exist throughout the galaxy - a development that makes the dream of the SG-1 team to travel throughout the universe in time a reality.</p>

                        Johnathan "Jack" O'Neill is a Colonel in the United States Air Force and the founding commanding officer of SG-1.
                        He joined the Air Force when he was 18 years old and was assigned to the Special Forces unit.
                        After retiring from the United States Air Force, he is called back to active duty by Major General George S. Hammond when the Stargate is unexpectedly activated and Cheyenne Mountain Complex.

                        Teal'c is a Jaffa and one of Earth's leading authorities on the Goa'uld, a race of beings that use other bodies as hosts.
                        Teal'c has a golden tattoo on his forehead. This represents the fact that he once served the System Lord Apophis as First Prime.
                        Like all Jaffa, Teal'c also carries an infant symbiote in his belly pouch that serves as an incubator for a larval Goa'uld.

                        Samantha Carter is a United States Air Force captain who joins the SG-1 team under the command of Colonel Jack O'Neill.
                        She is considered the Earth's leading expert on Stargate and other alien technology.
                        Captain Carter believes she should have been part of the first team to go to Abydos with Colonel Jack O'Neill and Dr. Daniel Jackson.
